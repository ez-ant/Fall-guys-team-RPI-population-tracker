# Fall-guys-team-RPI-population-tracker
SDD project

The RPI Population Tracker is a web-based interactive live map that could show the up-to-date number/density of people in each RPI building (except Student Dorms).

It is established for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary contact risks for students, faculties and visitors especially during COVID-19.

To Run this project, users need to install PIL as well as Python 3.
